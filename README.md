# FernNPR

[中文](https://github.com/DeJhon-Huang/FernNPR/blob/master/README_CN.md) | [English](https://github.com/DeJhon-Huang/FernNPR/blob/master/README.md)

FernNPR is a library for non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) in Unity. It offers a variety of NPR techniques, Character Renderering, Environmental Renderering, and Stable Diffusion!

## About The Pro Version

Please note that this open source project on Github is a free version that provides basic implementation. We are developing the Pro version and will release in Unity Asset Store.

**Pro Version is Comming Soon, Please follow the website**

## SD Graph

Fern SD Graph is a Graph tool integrated in Unity, which can obtain the scene information of Unity and generate images using Stable Diffusion.

[More Example](https://github.com/DeJhon-Huang/FernNPR/wiki/Stable-Graph-Example)

### Fern SD Graph Feature
1. Text2Img
2. Img2Img
3. Inpaint
4. Lora
5. ...

### Note

To use this tool, you need to deploy [stable diffusion webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) locally, and add the --api command to the COMMANDLINE_ARGS in the webui-user.bat file.

### future features
1. ControlNet
2. Node Optimization, more fluent, more efficient
3. Lora Weight
4. Scene preprocessing for ControlNet
5. Timeline for video
6. ...

## Tool
There are some useful tool.

### SmoothNormal And Texture Baker

![](DocAssets/texturebaketool.jpg)

This tool was developed by [DumoeDss](https://github.com/DumoeDss).

Smooth Normals is used to solve the problem of stroke breakage due to unsmooth model normals in runtime or editor. For more information, you can check [here](https://github.com/DumoeDss/AquaSmoothNormals).

Texture Baker can bake textures onto a mesh.

### Requirements

![](DocAssets/PackageManager.png)

1. Open **Window** -> **Package Manager**
2. Click **+** Button
3. Add package by name
4. Add: **com.unity.jobs**
5. Add: **com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json**

___

## Future Features

1. [ **Shader Tool** ] Used for smart generation of shaders, customization of shader functions, and optimization of shader keywords.
2. [ **Volume Render** ] The Volumetric Rendering series will include effects such as volumetric light, volumetric clouds, and volumetric fog.
3. [ **Post Processing** ] The post-processing series will expand the URP build-in post-processing as much as possible and add more effects.
4. [ **AI** ] The AI series will include Stable Diffusion Graph and ChatGPT.
