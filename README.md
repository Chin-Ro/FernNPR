## Tool
There are some useful tool.

### SmoothNormal And Texture Baker

This tool was developed by [DumoeDss](https://github.com/DumoeDss).

Smooth Normals is used to solve the problem of stroke breakage due to unsmooth model normals in runtime or editor. For more information, you can check [here](https://github.com/DumoeDss/AquaSmoothNormals).

Texture Baker can bake textures onto a mesh.

## Comming Soon

### FernAI

FernAI is a Graph tool integrated in Unity, which can obtain the scene information of Unity and generate images using Stable Diffusion.

The Stable Diffusion Graph has completed most of its development functionalities and is currently being tested and improved. It will be released very soon.

## Future Features

1. [ **Shader Tool** ] Used for smart generation of shaders, customization of shader functions, and optimization of shader keywords.
2. [ **Volume Render** ] The Volumetric Rendering series will include effects such as volumetric light, volumetric clouds, and volumetric fog.
3. [ **Post Processing** ] The post-processing series will expand the URP build-in post-processing as much as possible and add more effects.
4. [ **AI** ] The AI series will include Stable Diffusion Graph and ChatGPT.
